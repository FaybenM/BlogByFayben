        <h2>Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story</h2>
      
          
        <div class="wrapper">
        <br>
        <p>I just finished watching the season and I am a wreck!!! I don’t know how it’s possible but they somehow manage to make each season that comes out better than the other. Farmer George and Charlotte's love story is portrayed so beautifully even though it’s a bit tragic. When I first heard about the spin off I was a little worried it would purely be a sad/tragic love story, already knowing how it ends and knowing the queen’s demeanor in the original series. But, it surprised me to see more of a human side to her and watching the king’s pov episode helped to know he actually was smitten with her rather than simply using her to satisfy his mother. Also having the side plot of Reynolds and Brimsley was so bittersweet especially with that scene in the last episode of Brimsley dancing alone. I’m still not over this scene and will probably rewatch it a million times until season 3 of Bridgerton comes out!

        <p>I was a huge fan of the On My Block series! I was so upset when it ended but excited when I found out they were doing a spin off. I was so attached to those characters and was worried the new show wouldn’t be as great as the original, as it has happened with past shows, but I did enjoy this one. I will say the original is iconic and still my favorite but I loved this season. I was pleasantly surprised that some of the original cas was in it and made it much better in my eyes and easier to let go of the past ensemble. I was also a fan of Demi’s outfits; I thought she dressed the best in the show and would say Gloria was my second favorite. She had a few cute outfits. Overall it was entertaining and funny and I will be watching season 2, whenever that comes out!

        <h2>Abbott Elementary</h2>
      
          
        <div class="wrapper">
        <br>
        <p>I just got into this show and have been wondering why it took me a while to start it! I mean what initially drew me in, other than my sister telling me I should watch it, was Tyler James William because I loved Everybody hates Chris! The show is hilarious and at this moment I am halfway through the second season and am already obsessed with it! I will probably be finishing it within the next few days.
