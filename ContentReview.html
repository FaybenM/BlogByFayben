        <h2>Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story</h2>

        <p>I just finished watching the season and I am a wreck!!! I don’t know how it’s possible but they somehow manage to make each season that comes out better than the other. Farmer George and Charlotte's love story is portrayed so beautifully even though it’s a bit tragic. When I first heard about the spin off I was a little worried it would purely be a sad/tragic love story, already knowing how it ends and knowing the queen’s demeanor in the original series. But, it surprised me to see more of a human side to her and watching the king’s pov episode helped to know he actually was smitten with her rather than simply using her to satisfy his mother. Also having the side plot of Reynolds and Brimsley was so bittersweet especially with that scene in the last episode of Brimsley dancing alone. I’m still not over this scene and will probably rewatch it a million times until season 3 of Bridgerton comes out!
